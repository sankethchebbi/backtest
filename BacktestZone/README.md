# BacktestZone

BacktestZone is basically a no-code platform to create, customize, and backtest any number of trading strategies without coding for zero-cost. The application is designed in such a way that it is abstract in nature so that it doesn't confuse the beginners with fuzzy words. It also comes along with an easy-to-use interface to break down the complex stuff and more importantly, takes just a few clicks to build and backtest a trading strategy from scratch.
